1. Crumb cake ğŸ‘¶ (as early as I can remember) 
2. French cruellers ğŸ§’ (kid with exquisite taste) 
3. Devils food cake with coconut flakes ğŸ¥¥ (teen with an obsession for almond joys)
4. Donut holes ğŸ§‘ (adult with major for working behind the counter at her family's donut shop) 
5. _prediction_ Plain donuts ğŸ‘µ
